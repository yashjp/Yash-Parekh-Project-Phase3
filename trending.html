					<p>England Test match victories overseas are like London buses: you wait two years for one and then, just as you are contemplating abandoning the bus stop and returning home to see if your family is still there, two arrive in the space of 10 days.</p>

					<h3>Slingers pay the price for mistakes</h3>
					<p>Trailing 64-57 in the final quarter, the Singapore Slingers dug deep and launched their fightback
					With less than four minutes left on the clock, a brilliant tip by captain Ng Han Bin saw the Slingers go 69-68 up - the first time they had the lead over the Formosa Dreamers since the first quarter of the Asean Basketball League (ABL) game yesterday.
					That got the 1,800 crowd at the OCBC Arena into a frenzy as they tried to roar the team to victory.</p>
